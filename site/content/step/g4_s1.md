#### Image 1: Compare Months a Year for a Single Route
You can compare the months of a single year, in this case 2017, by adding multiples of a single route to your Route Analysis Tools and then setting the time bounds for each one to a different month in the year. This will be discussed more in Step 4.

#### Image 2: Compare Avg. Weekday for a Single Route
You can do the same with avg weekdays, in this case comparing average Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, by setting your resolution to day and selecting only one day per route component. This will be discussed more in Step 5.

#### Image 3: See Yearly Trends for a Single Route
You can also view yearly trends by setting up a single route component with "day" resolution and wide date bounds, in this case 1/1/2014-12/31/2016, while also setting up 3 more route components to look specifically at each year in those time bounds, at 5-minute resolution, in this case 1/1/2014-12/31/2014, 1/1/2015-12/31/2015, and 1/1/2016-12/31/2016. This will be discussed more in Step 6.
