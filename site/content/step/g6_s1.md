By default, Table shows the names of worst congested road segment sorted by ranking of ATRI's Total Freight Congestion Values in a given month. There are 4 other algorithms available to be applied for the table and this will be discussed more in step 2.
In table, you can find each bottlenecks' TMC id, 12 month value history graph, rank history/rank change graphs for last 12 month, values of algoritem you choose. 
From menu on top,  you can choose different measures of congestions, geography level, year/month, road type, and vehicle type. 

#### Image 3: Maps
On the right of the bottlenecks view page, you can find a map with weighted circle marks of each bottleneck locations on table.  If you put your mouse cursor over a bottleneck name on table, location of the bottleneck will be highlighted on the map.
