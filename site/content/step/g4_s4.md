### Image 1: Example of Month by Month Analysis
You can compare the months of a single year, in this case 2017, by adding multiples of a single route to your Route Analysis Tools and then setting the time bounds for each one to a different month in the year.

### Image 2: Add Routes For Each Month of the Year
Copy the same route by clicking the plus symbol in the route component row on the left navigation menu. You can have up to 12 copies of a route. 

### Image 3: Data Parameters
For each route component, set the month to a different month. Name that route component the month you selected (and hit enter to commit the new route name). Then, once all routes are set to a different month, click "Load All Data."
