### Image 1: Example of Avg Day of the Week Analysis
You can compare the days of the week (avg Monday, avg Tuesday, etc.) of any time bounds (start date and end date). In this case we'll look at Avg Days for each day of the week for 2016. 

### Image 2: Add Routes For Each Day of the Week
Add multiples of a single route to your Route Analysis Tools, in this case five, one for each day of the week. Copy the same route by clicking the plus symbol in the route component row on the left navigation menu. 

### Image 3: Data Parameters
For each route component, set it to a single day (in this case the Monday radiobutton is selected). Name that route component the day you selected (and hit enter to commit the new route name). Then, once all routes are set to a different day, click "Load All Data."
