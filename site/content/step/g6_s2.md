#### Image 1: Change Data Parameter.
From the first drop down menu, you can apply 4 different congestion analysis algorithms;
 ATRI's Total Freight Congestion Values (Click here to see more detail)
 Chen at al. algorithms (Click here to see more detail)
 Phed (Peak Hour Excessive Delay)
 TTTR (Truck Travel Time Reliability)
 LOTTR (Level of Travel Time Reliability)


#### Image 2: More Date parameter 
From other drop down menu, you can also apply different geography level (state-wide or a MPO),  year and a month, road type (All Roads or Interstate only), and Vehicle type (total, single, combined, passenger, and truck)


#### Image 3: Graphs by each 5 min epoch
If you double click each bottleneck name, it will pop out detail graphs with values of each algorithem and AADT (if available) in 5 min epoch.  Different vehicle type buttons are also available here to be applied immediately on graphs.
