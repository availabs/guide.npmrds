 ATRI's Total Freight Congestion Values (Click here to see more deatail)
 Chen at al. algorithem ( Click here to see more deatail )
 Phed (Peak Hour Excessive Delay)
 TTTR (Truck Travel Time Reliability)
 LOTTR (Level of Travel Time Reliability)


#### Image 2: More Date parameter 
From other drop down menu, you can also apply diffrent geogarphy level( state-wide or a MPO),  year and a month, road type (All Roads or Interstate only), and Vehicle type (total, single, combined, passenger, and truck)


#### Image 3: Graphs by each 5 min epoch
If you double click each bottleneck name, it will pop out detail graphs with values of each algorithem and AADT (if it is available) in 5 min epoch.  differnt vehicle type buttons also avaiable here to be applied directly on graphs.
