#### Image 1: Choose a congestion measure.
From the first drop down menu (red arrow), you can apply 5 different congestion analysis algorithms;
 ATRI's Total Freight Congestion Values (Click [**here**](http://atri-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ATRI-Bottleneck-Methodology-01-2017.pdf)  to see more detail),
 Chen at al. algorithms (Click [**here**](http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/ref/10.3141/1867-06)  to see more detail),
 PHED (Peak Hour Excessive Delay),
 TTTR (Truck Travel Time Reliability),
 LOTTR (Level of Travel Time Reliability)


#### Image 2: More date parameter 
From other drop-down menu, you can also apply different geography level (State-wide or a MPO),  year and a month, road type (All Roads or Interstate only), and Vehicle type (total, single, combined, passenger, and truck)


#### Image 3: Graphs by each 5 min epoch
If you double click each bottleneck name, it will open up a graph window with values of each measures and AADT (if available) in 5 min epoch, showing value trend for the full 24 hours.  You can also adjust starting and ending epoch by adjusting slide bar (red arrow) at the bottom of each graph.  Vehicle type buttons (red box) are also available here to be applied immediately on graphs. Once done, you can close graph window by clicking x mark on top right of graph window.
