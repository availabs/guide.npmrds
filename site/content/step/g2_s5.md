#### Image 1: Accessing Advanced Data Parameters
The red arrow in this image points "Advanced" settings. Click on this if the settings are simple (as shown here).

#### Image 2: Let's Compare 2017 to 2016
To compare 2017 to 2016, change the date bounds to 01/01/2017 - 08/31/2017 (August is the latest month of data at the time of writing this guide. Data will be up to data to the end of the month previous to the month in which you are viewing this). Do the same for 2016 by clicking on the second route component. Change the start date to 01/01/2016 and the end date to 09831/2016 (it is best to compare equal time bounds). 

#### Image 3: Load All Data
The red arrow in this image points "Load All Data." Click on this to load the data for both components simultaneously.
