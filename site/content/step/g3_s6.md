#### Image 1: Click Save Template or Save Report
The Red Arrows in this image are pointing to the save icon for both Reports and Templates. To save this as a specific report, with your specific data settings and the specific routes you chose, you'll want to save this as a report. To save the settings but not the specific data/routes, so that you can use these settings to analyze any routes in the future, save as a template.
