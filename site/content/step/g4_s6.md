### Image 1: Year to Year Analysis
You can compare Year to Year and even view trends of multiple years. In this case we'll look at Avg Days for 2014, 2015, and 2016, and also look at highly aggregated year averages by setting the date bounds to 1/1/2014-12/31/2016 with Resolution set to "Year." 

### Image 2: Data Parameters for Yearly Avg Day for Three Years 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Add 3 copies of the route you selected, for a total of 4 route components. See Substep 2 of Step 5, above. Then set three of those route components to yearly five minute averages by setting the time bounds to 1/1/2014-12/31/2014 for the 1st component, 1/1/2015-12/31/2015 for the 2nd, and 1/1/2016-12/31/2016 for the third. Name these route components for the year you've selected (2014, 2015 and 2016) and hit enter to commit the new route name.
 

### Image 3: Data Parameters for Three Years of Data (2014-2016) at Year Resolution
For the fourth route component set the resolution to Year, and the date bounds to 1/1/2014-12/31/2016. Name this route 2014-2016. Then click "Load All Data."
