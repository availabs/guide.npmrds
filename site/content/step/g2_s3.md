#### Image 1: View The Data Parameters
Click on a Route Componenet in the left navigation menu to view the data parameters of this Template. 

#### Image 2: Route Component Number 1 is 2016 Avg. Day
The first route component parameters is 1/1/2016 - 12/31/2016. This setting averages all of the data between and including those dates. Additionally, we have selected AM, PM, and Off Peak which will select the time bounds of 6:00AM - 7:00PM. We've also selected "All Vehicles." Lastly, the resolution is set to 5 Minutes, which is the most fine-grained time resolution. These data parameter settings will result in an "Average Day" meaning each and every 5 minute Epoch - there are 288 Epochs/day - will be averaged, so speeds, travel times, etc., at a given time, such as 9:00AM, will be a yearly average of that metric at that time. 

#### Image 3: Route Component Number 2 is 2015 Avg. Day
The second route component parameters is 1/1/2015 - 12/31/2015. These two route components are allowing the user to compare an average day in 2015 vs. and average day in 2016. It also allows a user to compare sums of data from both 2015 and 2016.
