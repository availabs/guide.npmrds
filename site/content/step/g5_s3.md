### Image 1: Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR)
LOTTR is the default setting for the Map View. LOTTR is a pass/fail measure. All passing segments are green, failing segments are red.

### Image 2: Truck Travel Time Reliability (TTTR)
TTTR is a ratio measure (95th/50th). Higher ratios are worse, segments with the highest are colored red, segments with the lowest ratios are colored green. The TTTR measure also only applies to Interstate roads. The red arrow on this image points to the filter for non-interstate. To remove non-interstate from the image click on this filter. The measure for the area never calculates non-interstate. 

### Image 3: Hours of Delay and Year/Month Settings
The final measure is Person Hours of Delay. The red box highlights the Area Measures, which is the total measure for the selected geography. The red arrow points to the year and month filters. These filters will change the scores both in the Area Measures box and on the map.
