### Image 1: Switching between State/MPO/County/Urban Area
This first menu item allows you to switch the geographic are for analysis. When you change between MPO and Counties, for instance, the table will change below. To access the PM3 Measures dashboard for any County, click on the corresponding row in the table.

### Image 2: PM3 Dashboard Year/Month Settings
In this image, we've clicked on one of the CDTC row in the MPO table, which opened up the dashboard for CDTC. The red arrow points to navigation filters for looking at different years, next to year is a filter for months. To view measures for an entire year, select Month: All. 

### Image 3: Accessing the PM3 Map
To access the PM3 Map, you'll first need to select a County or MPO (at the statewide level, the calculations are too processor intensive). The Map View link will only appear (red arrow) when you've selected a County or MPO.
