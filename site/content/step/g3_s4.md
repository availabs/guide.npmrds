#### Image 1: To Change the Data Parameters
Click on a Route Componenet in the left navigation menu to change the data parameters. 

#### Image 2: Advanced vs Simple
The "Simple" tools for changing data parameters include three settings: Year, Month, and Peak Selector. You can quickly look at an Averge AM Peak for 2017 by selecting Year: 2017, Month: All, Peak Selector: AM (this will set your time bounds to 6:00am - 10:00am). To view an entire day, select no peak, to view 6:00am-8:00pm select all AM Peak/PM Peak/Off Peak. The Red Arrow points to the Advanced/Simple toggle for switching between these data parameter settings. When using the "Simple" tools all routes data will be an AVERAGE of the Year/Month and Time that is selected.

#### Image 3: Advanced Settings
The "Advanced" tools for data parameters settings include detailed parameter settings for looking at almost any date/time bounds and time resolution. This includes looking at the raw data (5 min resolution for a single day). It also includes settings for looking at an average Tuesday or Friday in a given month or year (or all-time), resolutions of 5-min, 15-min, hour, day, weekday, month, and year, and Trucks, Passenger Vehicles, and All Vehicles. Lastly, the Advanced settings is where you can download raw data from the tool.
