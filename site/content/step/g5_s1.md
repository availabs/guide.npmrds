#### Image 1: The PM3 Statewide Dashboard
When you click on the PM3 tools (red arrow), you'll land on the statewide dashboard of PM3 measures. The first box lists the total miles of road being measured, both in Interstate and Non-interstate routes. The second box is a visualization of the Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR). LOTTR is a percentage of miles passing. Passing is a ratio of <1.5 of 80th percentile travel time over 50th percentile travel time for each segment of road during peak travel times. In this image the statewide percent of miles passing is 79.7% for Interstate and 75.6% for Non-interstate.

The next measure is the Truck Travel Time Reliability measure. This measure is a ratio 95th percentile travel time over 50th percentile travel time for each segment of road. The final graph (red) is the  Hours of Peak Hour Excessive Delay per Capita, showing hours per person experiencing excessive delay during peak hours.

The PM3 Map shows the PM3 measures by road segment, and is currently only available for MPO Regions and Counties.
